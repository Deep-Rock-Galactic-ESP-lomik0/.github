# Deep Rock Galactic ESP – Know Everything, See Everything 👷‍♂️👁️

## Mine Smarter, Not Harder

*Deep Rock Galactic* is all about surviving brutal cave systems, collecting rare resources, and fending off alien swarms. But let’s be real — navigating pitch-black tunnels with flares and a pickaxe is 🔥 when it works… and frustrating when you spend 20 minutes searching for **one Aquarq** 🪨

With a proper **DRG ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** cheat, you're done guessing. You’ll instantly see **where all the ores, enemies, and objectives are**, no matter where they’re hiding. Full visibility = full control 💥

## 🎮 What Is ESP in DRG?

ESP is a real-time wallhack-style overlay that reveals **everything important** in a mission, including:

* ✅ **Resource nodes** (Nitra, Gold, Jadiz, Bismor, etc.)
* 🐜 **Enemies** (Grunts, Exploders, Spitters, and swarm bosses)
* 🎯 **Mission objectives** (Eggs, Aquarqs, Fossils, Mini-MULE legs, Dreadnoughts)
* ⚙️ **Utility items** (Turrets, flares, resupplies, ziplines, M.U.L.E., Doretta)
* 🧭 **Teammates** (status, distance, class)

Basically, you’ll always know **what’s where**, even if it’s behind a wall or halfway across the map. No more digging in circles.
